# save final data as permanent file

The last lines in your data wrangling file should be code that outputs your wrangled dataset as a permanent file (e.g., an R dataframe or csv file). The purpose of this is to keep your wrangling code separate from your Shiny app code. In your Shiny app code, you can then load the wrangled dataset that you saved and jump right into (or more quickly into) defining the ui and the server functions.

```{r}
write_csv(final, "final.csv")
